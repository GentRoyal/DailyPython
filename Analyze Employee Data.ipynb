    "### Task: Analyze Employee Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Write a Python script that analyzes employee data to find out the following:\n",
    "1. The total number of employees in each department.\n",
    "2. The average salary of employees in each department.\n",
    "3. The employee with the highest salary in each department.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "You can create a dataset with the following columns: `EmployeeID`, `EmployeeName`, `Department`, and `Salary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Complete:\n",
    "1. Load the dataset into a suitable data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries).\n",
    "2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in functionalities or libraries like `pandas` to perform the following:\n",
    "   - Count the number of employees in each department.\n",
    "   - Calculate the average salary of employees in each department.\n",
    "   - Identify the employee with the highest salary in each department.\n",
    "3. Print the results in a clear format."
